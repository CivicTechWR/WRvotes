{% if include.category == "AllCandidates" %}

All-candidates meetings allow you to evaluate candidates **side by
side**, responding to the **same questions**. They are the **most
effective way** to quickly compare candidates.

If you don't have time to watch an entire recording, watch 2-3 rounds
of questions in the middle of the meeting. This will take 10-15
minutes.

Questions to ask yourself:
- Who attended the meeting? Who did not?
- Which candidates answered the questions directly? Which ones avoided
  the question(s) or pivoted to talking points?
- Which candidates demonstrated that they understand the complexities
  of the underlying issues? Which candidates offered overly-simplistic
  answers?

{% elsif include.category == "Questionnaire" %}

Questionnaires allow you to compare candidate responses side by side.
Often they are published by advocacy groups pushing particular
agendas.

Questions to ask yourself:
- Which candidates responded to the survey?
- In what ways did the candidates spin their answers to try and appeal
  to the organization asking the questions?
- Which candidates demonstrated a good understanding of the underlying
  issues?
- To what extent do you agree with the positions of the group running
  the questionnaire?

{% elsif include.category == "EndorsementList" %}

Some advocacy groups release endorsements of particular candidates.
Look at the advocacy group's positions and philosophies, and see
whether they align with your own. 

Questions to ask yourself:
- What political outcomes does this group advocate for? Do you agree
  with their goals?
- On what basis did this group make their endorsement? Did they gather
  statements from the candidates? 
- How transparent was their selection process?


{% elsif include.category == "ProfileList" %}

Candidate profiles allow you to read responses from different candidates side by side.
They allow you to compare candidates based on their backgrounds and
experiences. Often they will not tell you how candidates would address
specific issues. 


{% elsif include.category == "Article" %}

Articles can highlight issues of importance to the election and the electorate.

These items are (mostly) published by established news organizations.

{% elsif include.category == "Opinion" %}

Opinions, blog posts and discussions can be biased but useful. 
Discussions on forums can be wide-ranging. Sometimes opinions are
posted by people closely associated with a particular candidate. 

Questions to ask yourself:

- Can you identify where the writer(s) are coming from? Do you agree
  with their positions?
- Do the posters offer evidence for their opinions? Is that evidence
  credible? Is it proportionate, or blown out of proportion?

{% elsif include.category == "SingleProfile" %}

These posts cover specific candidates in depth. Sometimes the
candidates are asked specific questions and sometime they are allowed
to talk about whatever interests them. These profiles can offer more
in-depth coverage than you might get from a candidate's website.
