This is gross. You should have one entry per CategoryName in

{% if include.category == "AllCandidates" %}

All-candidates meetings are the best and quickest way to choose candidates (really!). 
They allow you to evaluate candidates **side by side**, responding to
the **same questions**. 

If you don't have time to watch an entire recording, watch 2-3 rounds
of questions in the middle of the meeting. This will take 10-15
minutes.

Questions to ask yourself:
- Who attended the meeting? Who did not?
- Which candidates answered the questions directly? Which ones avoided
  the question(s) or pivoted to talking points?

{% elsif include.category == "Questionnaire" %}

Questionnaires allow you to compare candidate responses side by side.
Ask yourself whether you agree with the candidate positions, and
whether the candidates demonstrate good understanding of the
underlying issues. 

{% elsif include.category == "EndorsementList" %}

Some advocacy groups release endorsements of particular candidates.
Look at the advocacy group's positions and philosophies, and see
whether they align with your own. 

Questions to ask yourself:
- What political outcomes does this group advocate for? Do you agree
  with their goals?
- On what basis did this group make their endorsement? Did they gather
  statements from the candidates? 
- How transparent was their selection process?


{% elsif include.category == "ProfileList" %}

Candidate profiles allow you to read responses from different candidates side by side.

{% elsif include.category == "Article" %}

Articles can highlight issues of importance to the election and the electorate.

{% elsif include.category == "Opinion" %}

Opinions, blog posts and discussions can be biased but useful. 
Sometimes people closely
aligned with particular candidates write opinions without disclosing
their relationships to the candidate.

Questions to ask yourself:

- Can you identify where the writer(s) are coming from? Do you agree
  with their positions?
- Do the posters offer evidence for their opinions? Is that evidence
  credible? Is it proportionate, or blown out of proportion?

{% elsif include.category == "SingleProfile" %}


These posts cover specific candidates in depth. Sometimes the
candidates are asked specific questions and sometime they are allowed
to talk about whatever interests them. These profiles can offer more
in-depth coverage than you might get from a candidate's website.
