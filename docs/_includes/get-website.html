include.network is 'twitter' (or maybe 'instagram' or other accounts
eventually)

include.account is the handle or the URL. We prefer URLs.

I don't know what 'first-char-website' is for. Maybe it was 
intended to look for an '@' symbol? We do not turn accountnames like
@elonmusk to their Twitter handles.
