Being a Politician
----------------------
{:.no_toc}

Sometimes it is not clear what our elected representatives do or why
they are necessary. This page offers some insight into these
questions. We reached out to some sitting and former politicians and
asked them about their experiences.

Some of the politicians we contacted offered individual accounts they
had put together in the past:

- School trustee Ted Martin [on being a
  trustee](./ted-martin-on-being-a-trustee)
- Kitchener ward Councillor Sarah Marsh [podcast
  interview](https://soundcloud.com/theglobalshuffle/city-councillor-sarah-marsh-learnings-in-the-nonpartisan-level-of-govt)

If you have other accounts, or if you are/were a sitting politician
and would like to add your experiences, contact us.

### Why do politicians run for office?

Some people are tapped on the shoulder. They participate in municipal
government in other ways (as staff, or on citizen's committees) and
other people ask them to run.

Some people are inspired to run by civic engagement groups. In this
election, several candidates ran after attending the [Waterloo Region
Women's Municipal Campaign School](https://learnhowtorun.com)
workshops.

Some people become politically actve because a municipal issue affects
them personally.

Many people are driven to run for office out of a sense of public
service.

### What do politicians find rewarding about the office?


### What do politicians find challenging?


### What do they do? What responsibilities do they have?

[It depends on the position]

### Is being a municipal politician a full-time job?

The positions of ward councillor, school trustee [and regional
councillor?] are not considered full-time positions. Some of these
elected officials hold other jobs in addition to their office; some do
not.

Mayoral positions and Regional Chair are considered full-time
positions.
