### What is this all about? 

On October 22, 2018, there will be a municipal election in Waterloo
Region (and the rest of Ontario). Up for election will be representatives of three different
levels of government: 

- Regional government (Regional Chair and Councillors)
- Municipal governments (Mayors and Ward Councillors)
- School boards (Trustees)

There is a good, readable voter's guide to municipal elections in
Ontario on the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing website:
[2018 Voters' Guide](http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page18734.aspx). 

### Why is municipal government important?

In Waterloo Region, your regional government is responsible for:

- Public health
- Social services
- Housing
- Child care
- Seniors' services
- Transportation (roads, signals, transit)
- Water supply
- Wastewater treatment
- Emergency medial services
- Policing
- Waterloo Regional International Airport
- Economic development
- Library, culture, and heritage resources
- Provincial offenses court
- Regional planning
- Licensing & by-laws

Your local municipalities are responsible for:

- Fire Services
- Recreation & Parks
- Arts & Culture
- Roads & Sidewalks
- Cemetaries
- Animal Control
- Water Retail
- Wastewater Collection
- Building Inspections
- Parking
- Local Planning
- Licensing & by-laws
- Libraries

That's a long list of things that have a direct impact on your daily life.

### I thought we just had an election?

On June 7 2018 Ontario had a provincial election. This is a municipal
election. Both sets of elections are held every four years. 


### Am I permitted to vote?

You may vote if you are a Canadian citizen who resides in Waterloo
Region, owns property here, or has a spouse who owns property here.
You must also be on the voter's list. 

There are some exceptions to these guidelines that may prohibit you
from voting: see the "Who cannot vote" section on the 
[Region of Waterloo Elections
Page](http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page18734.aspx). 


When voting you must show voter identification. See the [list of
acceptable voter
documentation](http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page219.aspx#voters) for a
comprehensive list.


### I voted provincially. Am I registered to vote?

Not necessarily. The provincial register of electors is distinct from
the municipal one. The municipal List of Electors is managed by MPAC,
the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC). 


### How do I register to vote?

MPAC maintains an
online tool for checking your voter registration at
<https://www.voterlookup.ca> . For some municipalities [WHICH ONES?]
you can also use this tool to add yourself to the List of Electors, or
to change your voting information.

You can also add yourself to the List of Electors via your
municipality. [HOW? FOR ALL MUNICIPALITIES?]

- [Wellesley](https://forms.wellesley.ca/Application-to-Amend-Voters-List)


### I am a student. Do I get to vote?

Yes. Depending on where your home address is, you may be eligible to
vote twice! 

See the "Post-secondary" section on the [Region of Waterloo elections
page](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/elections.aspx)


### How do I vote? May I vote using the Internet?

This depends on the area municipality in which you live. In North
Dumfries, Wellesley, and Woolwich you will **only** be able to vote
via the Internet or by telephone. The election period for all of these
area municipalities is from 10:00am on October 9 to 8:00pm on October 22. 
Proxy voting will not be allowed in any of these townships. For more information see the  page for your area
municipality: 

- [North
  Dumfries](https://www.northdumfries.ca/en/township-services/information-for-voters-.aspx)
- [Wellesley](https://www.wellesley.ca/en/township-services/voter-information.aspx)
- [Woolwich](https://www.woolwich.ca/en/township-services/information-for-voters.aspx)

In Cambridge you may vote by Internet (but not telephone?), or in-person during
an advance polling day or on election day. 

- [Cambridge](https://www.cambridge.ca/en/your-city/information-for-voters.aspx)

In the other area municipalities (Kitchener, City of Waterloo, Wilmot
Township) you may vote in-person during an advance poll or on election
day: 

- [Kitchener](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/city-services/election-2018-important-dates.aspx)
- [Wilmot](https://www.wilmot.ca/en/township-office/voting-locations.aspx)
- [City of
  Waterloo](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/where-when-to-vote.asp)


### There are a lot of positions to vote for! Do I have to vote for all of them?

No. You may refrain from voting for some positions if you wish; your
vote will count for the positions you did vote for. 

Similarly, if a position elects more than one representative (for
example, there are four Kitchener Regional Council representatives)
then you are not obligated to cast four votes for that position.

### How high is voter turnout in municipal elections?

Voter turnout tends to be significantly lower than for provincial or
federal elections. The CBC [published a
summary](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/voter-turnout-in-waterloo-region-stagnant-overall-1.2815625)
of turnout rates for Waterloo Region. In 2014, they ranged from a low
of 29.3% in Wellesley township to 40.6% in Wilmot township.

These rates are significantly lower than municipal election rates
throughout Canada, as [reported by Statistics
Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-640-x/2009001/tab/tab3-1-eng.htm). 

### What parties are running in this election?

Unlike provincial or federal politics, municipal candidates in our
municipality do not run under party banners. 

This has the advantage of potentially reducing partisanship, but it
means that candidates must be evaluated on their individual merits.

### I don't feel informed enough to vote. Where do I start?

Start by finding your municipal ward on the [ward map](/) or by
finding your ward in the [list of wards](/all-positions). There, you
can find the candidates running for each position in your area, their
websites, news articles about them, and events where they will be
appearing. 

Once you know your candidates, it is time to figure out who deserves
your vote. Here are some strategies for becoming informed relatively
quickly: 


- Attend all-candidates meetings for the races, or watch/listen to
  recordings of all-candidates meetings. This will cost you 2-4 hours
  per meeting, but is an effective way of comparing candidates against
  each other.

- Visit candidate websites and/or social media presences. This can
  give you a sense of what candidates stand for and whether their
  views correspond to yours, but is not great for comparing
  candidates. 

- Read the answers to surveys posted by special interest groups.
  Reading responses from different (especially opposed) groups is a
  good way to assess how candidates respond differently to different
  audiences. 

- Read news coverage of candidates. Beware that some news coverage on
  social media feeds are written by advocates for political
  candidates.

There are also less effective strategies, such as voting for whatever
candidate comes to your house and shakes your hand. Politicians know
this strategy is effective, and they devote a lot of time to this, but
other than identifying candidates who put time into door-knocking it
does not give you much information about which candidates are best for
their jobs.

### I don't feel informed enough to vote and there is not much time left.  What do I do?

If you are stretched for time, you can follow one or two races and
cast informed votes for those. The regional level of government is
important, and many people do not pay sufficient attention to regional
council candidates. Other influential positions are mayors and
regional chair. 

Spending an hour watching or listening to one all-candidates meeting
can help you select the best candidates quickly.

Alternatively, you can follow one or two races by reading the campaign
literature (in printed form or on the Internet) from the contenders,
and choosing the candidates that match your views most closely. 

### How do I follow what is going on during the election?

Local media provides lots of election coverage. 

On Twitter you can track the
[#wrvotes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wrvotes) and 
[#wrpoli](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wrpoli) hashtags. 

In addition there are some lists of candidate Twitter feeds that you
can follow: 

- Public school trustee feeds by @jpkitchener:
  <https://twitter.com/jpkitchener/lists/wrdsb-trustee-candidates>
- Overall nominees by @anitsirKTaylor: 
  <https://twitter.com/anitsirKTaylor/lists/wrvotes-2018>

There is an active discussion about the 2018 municipal elections on the
[Waterloo Region Connected
forums](http://www.waterlooregionconnected.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=34).



### I want to organize an all-candidates meeting. What do I do?

If there are not enough all-candidates meetings for the positions that
interest you (spoiler: there probably aren't) then you can organize
your own. This is not difficult, but does take some time and planning.

Judith Shane has created [a comprehensive
guide](https://urbanneighbourhoods.wordpress.com/2018/03/21/all-candidates-guide-judith-shane-march-2018-information-on-how-to-organize-a-candidates-meeting-at-the-municipal-provincial-or-federal-level/) to organizing all-candidates
meetings.

The City of Toronto also has a [guide to ward all-candidates
meetings](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/get-involved-how-government-works/how-the-city-works/learning-guides/ward-all-candidate-meetings/).
This guide contains some Toronto-specific information, but is good
overall.

Some of the volunteers on this website also have experience in
organizing all-candidates meetings, and would be happy to offer
guidance. Contact us using the email at the bottom of this page.

Once you have started organizing your meeting, be sure to let us know
about it so we can publish it on this website!


### What other groups are working on election education?

The Region of Waterloo links to election information for the different
municipalities at <https://wrvotes.com> . 

The (City of) Waterloo Voter Support Committee has a website at
<https://waterloovotes.com> 

A group called the [Waterloo Region Women's Municipal Campaign
School](https://learnhowtorun.com) held workshops on how to run for
political office. Several election candidates during this election
credit the campaign school for inspiring them to run for office. They
have a Twitter account here:
[@wrwomenrun](https://twitter.com/wrwomenrun).
