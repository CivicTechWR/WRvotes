<p class="bigtext">What? Another election?!</p>

Yep. On **October 22, 2018** there will be a municipal election in Waterloo
Region. 

Municipal elections can be confusing.
There are a lot of positions
to vote for! There are no political parties! How do you start
educating yourself so you can cast an informed vote?

<p class="bigtext">Don't panic. We've got you covered.</p>

Start by looking up the candidates that are running in your area. 
Use the map below to **locate your municipal ward**, and click the
information link. This will pop up a list of every position you can
vote for (including regional candidates, your mayor, and school board
trustees).

If you don't like maps (or don't have Javascript enabled on your
browser), you can find a page for your ward in our [ward
listing](./wards/). 


Along with candidate listings you will find links to upcoming events,
news articles, and other information that can help you get up to speed
quickly.

Also, check 
out our [resource pages](./resources). They contain lots of good
background information about the election. If you don't know **what is
going on**, or **why you should care**, you will find answers here. 


Here is the map. It loads more slowly than the rest of the page, so be
patient, or use the [ward listing](./wards/).
