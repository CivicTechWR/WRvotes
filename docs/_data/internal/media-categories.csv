AllCandidates,All Candidate Meeting Recordings,5,"All-candidates meetings are the best and quickest way to choose candidates (really!). 
If you don't have time to watch an entire recording, watch 2-3 rounds of questions in the middle of the meeting. Then ask yourself who is serious."
Questionnaire,Questionnaires,2,"Questionnaires allow you to compare candidate responses side by side. Ask yourself whether you agree with the candidate positions, and whether the candidates demonstrate good understanding of the underlying issues. "
EndorsementList,Endorsements from Organizations,3,"Some advocacy groups release endorsements of particular candidates. Look at the advocacy group's positions and philosophies, and see whether they align with your own. Investigate the basis on which they made their endorsements. Did they gather statements from the candidates and evaluate responses? Or did they base their endorsement on some other criteria?"
ProfileList,Grouped Candidate Profiles,3,Candidate profiles allow you to read responses from different candidates side by side. 
Article,Articles and News Items,3,Articles can highlight issues of importance to the election and the electorate.
