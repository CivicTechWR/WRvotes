title: About WaterlooRegionVotes
---

Waterloo Region Votes is a nonpartisan initiative to 
increase voter engagement during this fall's municipal election. 

Many people say, "I didn't realize there was an election" or "I did
not feel informed enough to vote". Our goal is to fix that.

In particular, we aim to:

- Make it easy for you to find out who is running in your geographic
  area.
- Make it easy for you to learn more about these candidates so you can
  cast an informed vote. To this end, we link to candidate websites,
  upcoming all-candidates meetings, candidate surveys, and other
  relevant information.
- Make it easy for you to understand how the municipal election is
  structured, what different elected officials do, and a sense of
  how municipal politics affects your life. 

## How to Help

Use the site! Learn about the election so you can cast an informed
vote. If there are aspects of the site that are confusing or
misleading, let us know. 

Spread the word! Encourage your friends, family, and social media
contacts to use this site, especially if they are not engaged in
municipal politics already. 

Improve the content! Are we missing information about candidates, events,
questionnaires or news coverage? Contact us at
civictechwr.wrvotes@gmail.com and submit them to
the site. Crowdsourcing resources helps improve the site for everyone.
We currently could really use help with: 

- Monitoring local news media
- Monitoring Facebook and Twitter for election-related news and events
- Tracking down candidate information (especially websites)
- Helping with promotion 


## Who is Responsible for This?

This site is a project of [CivicTechWR](https://civictechwr.org), a
local group that attempts to improve the lives of residents in
Waterloo Region through civic technology. 

You can join us! Come to one of our meetups at
<https://meetup.com/CivicTechWR/> to get involved.
