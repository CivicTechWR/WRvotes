# Waterloo Region Votes

This repository is published to https://www.waterlooregionvotes.org

## Why?

As a citizen in Waterloo Rrgion, it can be a lot of work to try to figure out who's going to be on the ballot for municipal elections. You need to check the regional site, your local ward, and then try to figure out which list of school board trustees applies to you. Each municipality in the region is on a different page. The sites are all linked from wrvotes.com, but it's still a lot of back and forth, and the municipal sites do not list all candidate meetings. Getting to the ballot box fully informed isn't easy. We want to make it easier.

## Goals

Encourage greater municipal election participation through candidacy, campaign volunteership and increased voter turnout.   

## What are we trying to build?
1.  Identify wards with low historic (2014) candidate participation
    -  *Why?* Help people identify where they should get active as candidates, before nominations close (May 1-July 27)
    -  *What to answer:*  How do I run?
2.  Consolidated & easy to navigate access to basic candidate information
    - who
    - where
    - links to websites, emails, phone #s
3.  Inform the community on debates/all candidate meetings for their wards
4.  Get out the vote on October 22
    - *How?*
