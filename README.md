## About

## What Are We Building?

1. **Consolidated & easy to navigate access to basic candidate information**
   - who
   - where
   - links to websites, emails, phone numbers
   - **help wanted:** find information for candidates that have nothing listed!

2. **Inform the community on debates/all candidate meetings for their wards**
   - **help wanted:** monitoring news sites, social media feeds, etc.

3. **Easy to navigate resources on who's responsible for what**
   - So voters can make an informed choice for each position
   - **help wanted:** Do you have knowledge or experience in local politics? Can you explain what a school board trustee does?

4. **Get out the vote**
   - **help wanted:** promotion, information on how & when to vote, information on how to ensure you're registered, etc.

This project provides voter information and election data analysis for the 2026 municipal elections in Waterloo Region, helping residents make informed decisions by providing candidate information, polling locations, and election results.
