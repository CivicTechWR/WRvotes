## CivicTechWR builds WaterlooRegionVotes.org to encourage voter engagement

A dedicated group of local volunteers have come together to create **https://WaterlooRegionVotes.org**, a one stop voting information spot. With this helpful website, it will be easy to become engaged with the Waterloo Region municipal election on Monday October 22, 2018.

Voter turnout [is lower](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-640-x/2009001/tab/tab3-1-eng.htm) for municipal elections than for other levels of government in Canada. People express they struggle with municipal elections because they don’t know where to go to find information on the candidates or don’t understand how municipal governance affects their daily lives. The reality is, municipal government is fundamentally important and has more of an impact on how cities and townships are shaped than are other levels of government. However, voting municipally is all too often overlooked. Program funding, garbage collection, safe injection sites, shelters, and bike lanes are only a few of the matters managed by municipal government. 

WaterlooRegionVotes.org has compiled candidate listings, events, news articles, and more into one easy to navigate website.  Learning about the election and making an informed decision based on where you live in Waterlo Region is one click away. Voters no longer have to feel overwhelmed by the complexities of voting municipally. Individuals are encouraged to contribute election content to produce a more comprehensive website by emailing the municipal election website team at [civictechwr.wrvotes@gmail.com](mailto:civictechwr.wrvotes@gmail.com).

*“I've always considered voting to be the most basic of civic duties, but it's not straighforward to keep track of all of the different offices and candidates in municipal elections. In 2014, I remember making it to the polling station, thinking I was ready to make an informed vote, only to discover that one of the positions was a 'choose two,'”* said Kristina Taylor. *"I'm selfishly helping with this project so that it's way easier to make an informed choice this time."*
