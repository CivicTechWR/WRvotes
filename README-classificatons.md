What is fair game for the site? What goes where?
================================================

Reducing Duplicates
-------------------

- When an event, questionnaire, etc applies to multiple positions use
  the most general position (if there is one) or list the applicable
  positions if there is not. 

  For example, articles about all of Cambridge can be tagged 
  "Cambridge-Maypr" and articles about all of Waterloo Region can be
  tagged "Regional-Chair"

- All-candidates events should be tagged with all relevant positions,
  however. 

- The Election-Info tag is strictly for information about the election


Events
------

- Events should be related to candidate campaigning in some way
- Events from individual candidates may be posted, but must not have
  anything in ForMultipleCandidates


Media
-----

- News articles from mainstream (lamestream?) media sources count as
  news.
- All candidate surveys count and should be tagged with IsComparison
- Meeting recordings of all-candidates meeting should be tagged with
  IsComparison
- News opinion pieces by columnists are fair game but must be marked
  "Opinion"
- News items that are about election issues (safe injection sites,
  intensification) but not about the election directly are probably
  not fair game. 

### Fuzzy lines

- Letters to the editor? Probably not.
- Arbitrary opinions on blogs? Dunno. Maybe they count as opinions.
- News articles outside the mainstream? Maybe. The standard for
  marking as news and not opinion should be relatively high (ie the
  article should be fair to all sides)
